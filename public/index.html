  <p>The SPJ Chatting Site is a real-time messaging website designed for efficient communication, it is built with a robust backend using Node.js, MySQL, and Socket.IO, as well as a dynamic frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports a user account system to ensure a personalized and secure connection and message tracking. While we developed the platform, we encountered challenges such as learning and implementing the MySQL database for local data storage and integrating Socket.IO for two-way communication linked to user accounts online. Additionally, we connected the database to save messages associated with their usernames and ensured the system functioned properly. Despite these challenges, the platform delivers a simple easy to use and real-time communication experience designed for our users.</p>
